## Application Overview

BookstoreManager is a WPF application developed in C# using Entity Framework Core.
The purpose of the application is to demonstrate CRUD operations against a relational database.

The application allows the user to:

- Select a bookstore

- View the inventory of the selected bookstore

- View a central catalog of available books

- Add books from the central catalog to a bookstore

- Remove books from a bookstore

- Update book quantities and save changes to the database

All data access is handled using Entity Framework Core and a SQL Server database.

### Main Window – Bookstore Inventory
When the application starts, the main window is displayed with the user interface for managing bookstore inventories. After selecting a store, its inventory is loaded and displayed in the table.
